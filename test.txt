Once upon a time there was a Cyborg Ninja that lived in the most dangerous city.
They were pretty happy with how things were going, so they decided to play fortnite.

So they took their MoNkE that could swim, and they went to travel out in the world.
On their way, they met a Cyborg monkey that was very good at peepeepoopoo, so they decided to take this new friend with them.

They had many adventures, like the one where they fell down a infinite hole and another one where they killed a chicken.
One day, the friends woke up with The Joker trouble on their mind, and went for one last adventure.

A town nearby needed their help, and when they tried to help, they managed to get tricked because no help was needed. They got robbed blind and were left for dead.
With a last adventure finished, the friends split up, each going back home to eat nuggets and live happily ever n' after.

for the first option: one suggestion from chef: Dummy the Red Riding Hood :)
