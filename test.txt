Once upon a time there was a Cyborg Ninjas that lived in the most Dangerous city.
They were pretty **** with how things were going, so they decided to ****.

So they took their **** that could ****, and they went to travel out in the world.
On their way, they met a **** that was very good at ****, so they decided to take this new friend with them.

They had many adventures, like the one where they **** and another one where they ****.
One day, the friends woke up with **** on their mind, and went for one last adventure.

A town nearby needed their help, and when they tried to help, they managed to ****.
With a last adventure finished, the friends split up, each going back home to **** and live happily ever n' after.

for the first option: one suggestion from chef: Dummy the Red Riding Hood :)
